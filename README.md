# 100-Days-Of-Python

Follow me on my journey from 0 Python experience to Python Master

## :pushpin: Whats the Purpose?

The purpose of this repo is to be my python Diary. I want to use this platform to show my growth within the coding language. 
I have 0 experience in Python development and this Diary is made to show my growth in the coming days. 

## ðŸ““ How this will work?

Over the course of the next few months I will be uploading projects centered around [100 days of Code by Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

- After Completion of the code I will upload a file to the Script folder.
- After the first 30 days are complete, I will do a restructure and rebuild my initial code.
- This will show my progress and how much I have improved in my journey to become a Dev.

## ðŸš€ Code with me and join in.
